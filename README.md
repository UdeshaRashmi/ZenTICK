 ZenTick is a minimalist todo app for calm, focused task management. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), it offers a fast RESTful API with validation. The React frontend, styled with Tailwind CSS, creates a serene interface where completing tasks feels peaceful and effortless. 🧘‍♂️
